Additional infestructure:

I have added a "BookedLessons" view and class to handle some functionality in there to better abstract the functionality. I used a local database to test all this functionality I have left this commented out and added the line that would have used the provided database. This was as a result of an email response stating that it was a tricky process to get access to the provided database.
